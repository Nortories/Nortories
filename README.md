### 🚀 About Me
I have a genuine passion for coding and problem-solving. I believe in the processes of simplification and enjoy learning technology that helps in automating my day-to-day tasks and goals. I fall asleep thinking about software design,  and how I can implement features or new ideas.

### 🎓 Academic Projects
During my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to develop a educational mobile math app using the Unity engine. On my spare time I wanted a way to keep track of the amount of time I spent on certain tasks, so I developed task-tracker to store, manage and track the amount of time I spend on tasks, this showcasing my ability to turn concepts into tangible solutions. I also won 3rd place at the 2023 BYUI hackathon in communications, programming and wiring Arduinos and screens to make a controller that outputs HEX color values to a screen from three inputs, with the object of player 1 adjusting the values with the controller and only player being about to see the outputs. The goal is to communicate with one another to match the color values with a randomly selected color.
