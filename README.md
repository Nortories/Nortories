👋 Hi there! I'm Joshua Sooaemalelagi, a passionate Software Engineering student at BYU – Idaho.

🚀 I absolutely love coding, problem-solving, software and diving into the tech world. Recently, I’ve been getting hands-on with virtualization and IT infrastructure during my internship at ECS. It’s been an amazing experience where I installed and configured VMware ESXi on a multiple host server setup, clustered servers using VMware vSphere, and set up a Windows Server domain within virtual machines. I also took on the challenge of designing networking solutions and applying STIGs to boost security and compliance.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a BS in Software Engineering with a minor in Web Development at BYU-Idaho, where I maintain a 3.9 major GPA. I've earned certifications in AWS Cloud, Computer-Aided Design, Programming, Web Development, and Software Design. I will be graduating December 2024.

🏆 I've placed 6th in the Hill Air Force Base Hackathon and 3rd in the BYU-I Hackathon, showcasing my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. My projects include creating an interactive portfolio webpage, developing a task tracker app, and designing a child education app using Unity.

🛠️ Before tech, I worked as a construction foreman. This unique background has shaped my leadership, adaptability, and teamwork skills, giving me a fresh perspective on tackling problems.

🌍 I'm always excited to learn more, grow my skills, and contribute to a collaborative team. I believe that bringing together diverse experiences and viewpoints is key to driving innovation.

🌱 Let's connect! I’m open to chatting about the latest tech trends, exchanging coding tips, or exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out!
